% Exercises:

% 1. Write a function thata reverses the order of bytes in a binary

% 2. Write a function term_to_packet(Term) -> Packet that returns a binary
% 	 consisting of a 4-byte length header N followed by N bytess of data
% 	 produced by calling term_to_binary(Term)

% 3. Write the inverse function packet_to_term(Packet) -> Term that is the
% 	 inverse of the previous function

% 4. Write some tests in the style of (Adding Tests to Your Code, on page
% 	 46) to test that the previous two functions can correctly encode terms
% 	 into packets and recover the original terms by decoding the packets.

% 5. Write a function to reverse the bits in a binary.
