% 1. 
	% Download the code for a port driver given earlier and test it on your
	% system.

% 2.
	% Go to git://github.com/erlang/linked_in_drivers.git. Download the code
	% for a linked-in driver and test it on your system. The tricky part of
	% this is finding the correct commands to compile and link the code. If
	% you fail this exercise, ask for help on the Erlang mailing list.

% 3. See whether you can find an operating system command to discover which
% CPU your computer has. If you find such a command, write a function that
% returns your CPU type, using the function os:cmd to call the OS command.
