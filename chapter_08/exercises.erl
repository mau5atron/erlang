% Exercises for Chapter 8

% 1: 
% Reread the section abotu Mod:module_info() in this chapter. Give the
% command dict:module_info(). How many functions does the module return?

% 23 functions!
% Also, this is a great way at peaking at how many and what functions are
% available for a given module!!

% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

% 2:
% The command code:all_loaded() returns a list of {Mod, File} pairs of all
% modules that have been loaded into the Erlang system. Use the BIF
% Mod:module_info() to find out about these modules. Write functions to
% determine which module exports the most functions and which function name
% is the most common. Write a function to find all the unambiguous
% functions names, that is, function names that are used in only one
% module.

% Leaving this for later :)
